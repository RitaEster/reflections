How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

    
>>> It was helpful to get directed to differences.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
 efficient programmer in the long term?

    
>>> I can learn from the past, 
    I can see improvements in a program. 
    I can find errors by searching for differences.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
>>> I can choose when a logical step is completed.
    It does not make sense to commit at an arbitray point of time.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
>>> A program is a project of multiple files working together.
    Those need to be treated together as well.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
>>> when in a repository, 
    git log gives all the versions with version messages and version id, date, Author.
    git diff allows to compare two versions.
    you can chnage the colours of git using git config --global color.ui auto.
    q is for quit.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

    
>>>

 I can always go back, no problem. Helps to try things out, to explore.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
>>> I want to integrate this into android studio.
